### Examples

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lionelbarrow/examples.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lionelbarrow/examples)

A lightweight behavioral testing library for Go.

Here's how it works: Write regular tests using the Go standard library, making your assertions with the [quiz library](https://github.com/benmills/quiz). If you ever feel like you're writing tests that should be grouped together, use a `When` or `Describe` function to group them, like this:

```go
import (
  e "github.com/lionelbarrow/examples"
  "testing"
)

func TestMyClass(t *testing.T) {
  e.When("writing software", t,
    e.It("helps to have tests", func(ex *e.Example) {
      ex.Expect(1).ToEqual(1)
    }),

    e.It("helps to have correct tests", func(ex *e.Example) {
      ex.Expect(1).ToEqual(2)
    }),
  )
}
```

Run the tests with `go test` as usual. With the code above, this will output:

```
--- FAIL: TestMyClass (0.00 seconds)
examples.go:32: When writing software it helps to have correct tests:
                Expected 2 to equal 1.
                /Users/lionel/fake_examples/fake_test.go:15
```

As far as the `go test` command is concerned, everything within the `TestMyClass` function is the same test. The Go standard library does a number of useful things (such as automatic parallelization) to tests run through the `go test` command, so it makes sense to keep your test groups small.
